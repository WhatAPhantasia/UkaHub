Subcon Small Talk v0.5.0

FOOOOOL!! A funny little balloon for Snatcher. Includes three sizes of the normal bubble and one narration bubble, as well as a few other doodads. Don't mind the extra files: You can swap the names around if you want to change an aspect of the balloon!
COOL THINGS: 
- Use the different balloon sizes (\b[2], \b[3]) and narration balloon (\b[4])
- Call the clickwaitmarker (\x) for the Genuine A Hat In Time experience

If you downloaded this separately from Snatcher, you can get him here: [INSERT DL LINK LATER LMAO]

Aaaalso this is meant to go with the Curse Casual font so just install the .ttf if the font is showing up weird
