EXPRESSION GUIDE

there's a few hard coded surfaces, if you don't want to fenangle with intervals.

\s[0] - default sakura
\s[1] - embarrassed sakura
\s[2] - surprised sakura
\s[3] - worried sakura
\s[4] - sad sakura
\s[5] - smiling sakura
\s[6] - content sakura
\s[7] - angry sakura
\s[8] - thinking sakura
\s[9] - bored sakura

and just add a 1 before the number if you want kero surfaces.

COLLISION GUIDE

sakura has three collisions: 1 - pet, 2 - face, 3 - hair.
kero has two collisions: 1 - pet, 2 - face. pull up surfaces.txt and display hit rect for more help.

INTERVAL GUIDE

...actaully uhhhhh jam was NOT enough time for me to implement intervals so thats coming in a Later Update :sob: if you make a project with them in this state make sure to remove the homeurl in descript.txt if you don't want your surfaces to potentially be messed up with an update
