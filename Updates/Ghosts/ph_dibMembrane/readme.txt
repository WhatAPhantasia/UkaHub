-= Shooting Star: Dib Membrane!! =-

Dib ends up on your desktop after messing with his spelldrives, and he's fascinated by it!!
This is a Dib vaguely based off of one of my fics, Shooting Star, so there's tons of fanon with this dude!! You can right click and change his shell/look to an ETF one.

He comes with a music player (including a few lemon demon songs), cryptid facts, and 50% less head size! He also has most of the basic ghost features like checking your calendar, emptying your recycling bin, etc :)


- - IMPORTANT - -
-You can use "Shell Scaling" the SSP menu to change his size if he's too small/big for you. I made him really big so uh. You're probably gonna have to haha
-Make sure to uncheck Options > Preferences > ghost(2) > Balloon Scaling Linkage so his speech bubbles stay consistent when you scale him :)
-You can uninstall him by deleting the ph_dibMembrane folder out of your ssp/ghost/ directory, or by turning on uninstall in his personal menu, then selecting 'Uninstall' in the SSP menu.

-- Quick User Guide --
-Move your mouse back and forth over his head to pet him (you don't have to click)
-Double click his face to hit him (It'll warn you first, don't worry)
-Double click his body to open his personal menu
-Right click him to open the SSP menu
-Hit the T key when he's the focus to make him say something
-Hit the R key to make him repeat what he just said
-Hold down CTRL to speed through text
