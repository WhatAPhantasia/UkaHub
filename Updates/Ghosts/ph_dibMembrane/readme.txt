-= Shooting Star: Dib Membrane!! =-

After messing with his spelldrives, Dib ends up on your desktop and is fascinated by it!!!
This is a version of Dib from one of my fics, Shooting Star, so his personality is different from canon: He's still Dib, he just has a bit of coffee and honey flavoring :]

He comes with a music player (and a few of dib's playlists), cryptid facts, and 50% less head size! He also has most of the basic ghost features like checking your calendar, emptying your recycling bin, all that fun stuff.

If you want to open up more dialogue pools, I recommend installing:
LEVIDRE'S ZIM GHOST: https://levidre.github.io/ukagaka/zim-and-gir
MY ELY CROWE GHOST (warning: will open up more oc x canon romance dialogue):
You can also find them under the Creator + Misc Links in the SSP menu.


- - IMPORTANT - -
-You can use "Shell Scaling" the SSP menu to change his size if he's too small/big for you. I made him really big so uh. You're probably gonna have to haha
-Comes with a few different looks! Change them in the "Change Shell" SSP menu option. Useful if you don't like the fanon art ;]
-Make sure to uncheck Options > Preferences > ghost(2) > Balloon Scaling Linkage so his speech bubbles stay consistent when you scale him :)
-You can uninstall him by deleting the ph_dibMembrane folder out of your ssp/ghost/ directory, or by turning on uninstall in his personal menu, then selecting 'Uninstall' in the SSP menu.
