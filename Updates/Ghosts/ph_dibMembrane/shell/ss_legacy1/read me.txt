Hoooo boy ok this was the first complete(?) version of dib i drew for ukagaka purposes back in 2020, then like, never developed further haha

this is a kinda legacy shell u can use for fun, but like he only has 1 surface sooooooooooooooooooo yk
also he is very big and i dont feel like rescaling him so do it urself in the ssp menu!!!!!!!!!!!!!
