//Free or Bound
//This determines whether or not your ghost can be moved freely around the desktop or if it's stuck to the bottom or top of the desktop.  The three values you can use here are free, bottom, and top. If your ghost is cut off at the chest or something, then you'd want it to be stuck to the bottom of the screen. Likewise if you're doing a hanging ghost, like Glados or Flowey or something, then you'd want to use top. Right now, this is set to free, meaning the ghost can be moved around freely by the user.

//Balloon Co-ordinates
//These basically define where your balloon starts for your main character (sakura) and your secondary character (kero). While you're testing your ghost, you'll notice that moving the balloons around shows you a set of coordinates on the bottom. Move your balloons where you want them, write down the coordinates, and copy them here. Otherwise, you can just leave them at 0. Your user will adjust them as they need to, so I wouldn't sweat this too much.
//Alignment means which way you want your balloon to be facing. There are three options here: right, left, or none. If you choose right or left, the balloon will ALWAYS face right or left. If you put none, however, the balloon will flip sides whenever it hits the side of the screen. For example, if you drag your ghost with a right balloon all the way to the right side of your screen, it'll flip the balloon to the left side. I generally prefer putting it to none because it's convenient to me to flip balloons as I need to, but this is up to you.

//If you have images you want to set for your menu, this determines the alignment of the background and foreground pictures. You can put in lefttop, righttop, or centertop, and bottom or top for the sidebar. You'd be replacing righttop or bottom with whatever alignment you prefer.
