//--surface.append-------------------------------------------------------------------
//This function is primarily for advanced users, so you can skip it if it seems too scary to you. Otherwise, read on. It may be useful.

//Surface.append basically applies the coding within the brackets to the poses specified in the number range. Specifically in this case it applies to collisions. If the collision areas for your ghost don't change very much from pose to pose, then you can set them here for multiple surfaces at once and save yourself some time.
//I'm not actually going to use surface.append since Girl and Triangle move around too much for their collisions to be that consistent between poses, but it's something could potentially come in handy for advanced users or ghost makers who have very stationary ghosts, so I'll leave it here and just append it to surfaces that don't exist so it won't get in the way. If you want to use this, study this example and see how it can apply to your own ghost.

//surface.append500-590 
//this is appending this code to Surface500 through Surface590.
//There are actually a few special ways you can refine this! For example, surface.append500-590,205 would append the code to Surface500 to Surface590, as well as Surface205. 
//surface.append500-590,205,!507-509 it would do the same, except it would skip Surfaces507 through 509.
//you can have multiple surface.appends as well, if you want to append one set of code to one range of surfaces and another to another. For example, one set of collisions to your main character and one to your side character.


//--Unique Collision cursors------------------

//If you messed with the default Emily ghost at all, you may have noticed that when your cursor was over her chest, it changed to a sort of gripping hand instead of a pointer finger. "How do I do that?" you may wonder. Setting up sakura.cursor is how!

//sakura.cursor 
//{ 
//mouseup0,Head,system:hand 
//mousedown0,Head,system:finger 
//mouseup1,Face,system:hand 
//mousedown1,Face,system:grip 
//} 

//What this does is change the mouse cursor. You can see it's split into mouseup and mousedown, and it uses the names you gave your Collisions up there. So when the mouse is hovering over Girl's head, it uses the system cursor that looks like a hand. When you click and hold, it looks like a finger. You can uncomment these lines to see for yourself. Likewise, when you hover your mouse over Girl's face, it looks like a hand, and when you click down, it looks like a gripping hand. You can keep adding unique cursors for all your collisions by sequentially numbering them, like mouseup/down2, mouseup/down3, and so on.

//The system cursors you can use for this are "arrow", "cross", "no", "hand", "grip", "finger", "wait", "text", "move", and "help". You can probably guess at what they look like. Feel free to use whatever cursor you think would best match your collision.

//To set this up for the secondary character, just change sakura to kero, as usual.


//--Tooltips------------------

//Maybe you'd like a tooltip to pop up when your user is hovering over a hitbox on your ghost. It works much the same as above!

//sakura.tooltips 
//{ 
//Head,This is Girl's head. 
//Face,This is Girl's face.  
//}

//Basically put the name of your collision first, then what you want the tooltip to say. Uncomment this function and hover over Girl's hotspots and you can see how it works. It may be handy for warning your users about punching your ghost or something, or for silly reasons, I dunno. It's up to you!
//Like above, replace sakura with kero for the secondary character.



//--Surface.alias------------------


//There is another function along the same lines of surface.append and it's surface.alias. What it does is assign a range of numbers to a single number or word that can be called using \s[]. So here's an example.

//sakura.surface.alias
//{
//6666,[1229,1230,1231,1235]
//}

//What this means is that I could then go \s[6666] in dialogue and it would call any of these four Surfaces in the brackets. You can do words as well, like creepy,[1229,1230,1231,1235], and then you could call it with \s[creepy]. This may sound like a convenient shortcut to using words instead of numbers for your ghost's expressions, but I'd probably stick with numbers, really. It just feels like it'd backfire on you eventually.
//You can do the same thing with the side character by using kero instead of sakura.

//kero.surface.alias
//{
//6667,[1228,1232,1233]
//6668,[1228,1232,1233,1234]
//}
//And as you can see, you can have multiple surface aliases set up at any point. In this example, kero has both 6667 and 6668 defined as a range of Surfaces. So \s[6667] would call one of those three Surfaces, and \s[6668] would call one of those four Surfaces.

//---

//Now, if you don't think this is enough Surfaces and want to add more, all you have to do is copy and paste a chunk of Surface code, give it a new number, and then do whatever you want with it. You can define Surfaces all the way up to 999 without running into problems, so go crazy with them if you want! Some of my ghosts have a ridiculous amount of Surfaces because I have no self-control.
//Of course, to add new poses, you need to draw new frames for those poses. And I say again, make sure all your frames for a character are the same size if you can! It's so much easier to just put 0,0 than find specific coordinates. Unless you've run into the replace problem with mouths, in which case there's not much you can do about that.
//Once you add a new pose, save your surfaces.txt file and reload your shell using the Development Panel Reload option, or by just reloading your ghost entirely via Utilities - Reload Ghost. You can use Surface Test in the Development Panel to check your new Surface and see if it works and looks right! I always recommend testing your Surfaces, and it's usually pretty easy and simple. If it doesn't look right, tweak surfaces.txt, save, and try again.

//The length of this file is limited only by your imagination!



//*********************More on SERIKO coding*******************************


//I mentioned up above talking about some SERIKO functions for advanced users, so here I'll explain how some of them work. You can read about these on the SERIKO page on the walkthrough as well with (presumably) easier formatting on the eyes lol.


//--Random things
//You can have random things appear for a little while and then disappear using the random interval. This could be anything from a thought to an expression to a bird to a movement or whatever.

//6interval,random,60 //here the interval is set to random with a value of 60, meaning every 60ms there's a chance this will randomly happen.
//6pattern0,0404,0,overlayfast,0,0
//6pattern1,-1,5000,overlayfast,0,0

//This is much the same as the lines above. You'd replace 0404 with whatever image you'd be using. 5000 is the delay on the frame, so this stays on the screen for about 5 seconds. You can replace that value with whatever you want to change the timing, and change the number after random at the top to adjust how often it might occur.
//Note that at the end the image file number it calls is -1. -1 returns to the base default pose, so you'll want to end most unique or new animations with this to bring your ghost back to normal.


//Interval Stacking
//This is definitely for advanced users, so if you're not interested in the HARD STUFF, you can move on, haha.
//Basically, what you can do with a surface is add a bunch of intervals that are never called (thus the never tag). Then when you are calling the pose with \s, you can add an \i tag with the right number to bring up that interval. What is the actual use of this? This is a perfect way to do eyebrows, for one. You can set up a variety of eyebrows for the same Surface under different intervals, set them all to never, and then just call them in the one pose with \s[0]\i[8] or whatever i number you need. You can also use multiple \i tags to call multiple intervals at the same time to layer effects, like \s[0]\i[5]\i[8]\i[22]. I used this in Hunter and Smoker to layer things like Hunter's ears, her eyes, and her eyebrows to create a ton of different expressions within the same pose.
//I am absolutely positive I will use this method with all my future ghosts since it saves SO MUCH SPACE because I make like a BILLION poses for everyone, but whether or not anyone else ever will, I have no idea. But that's basically how it works.

//This example bit of code here is an eyebrow frame set to never.
//8interval,never
//8pattern0,224,0,overlayfast,0,0


//--Stopping Intervals
//This is a huge part of interval stacking above, although you can use it for other things.
//So, I mentioned Hunter's ears. I wanted them to be able to move around with her mood, and I finally figured out a way to do it - I made her base element with no ears, and then set her default ears to "always". The problem was, how do I change the ear position if her default ears are always on? Through the use of a SERIKO function called stop, that's how. Basically, I would stop the always default ear interval and start the new one. I'm just going to straight up copy a snip of the code from there into here to look at. See how interval 21 stops 20. You can do the same thing with start instead of stop to start an interval - this can come in handy for stopping and starting different talk animations if you have smiling/serious talk frames in one pose.

//Ears back
//20interval,always
//20pattern0,182,0,overlay,0,0

//Ears neutral
//21interval,never
//21pattern0,0,0,stop,20 //the interval it's stopping as at the end, in this case it stops interval 20
//21pattern0,172,0,overlay,0,0

//There are a lot of ways you can use this. For example, in Hunter's battle-ready animation, she'd always be bouncing on her heels normally, but I put in a stop check for her talk interval so she'd stay still and her mouth frames wouldn't get all screwy. Perhaps others can think of other creative ways to use this feature.


//--Layering
//You can think of the intervals in a Surface as layers in a PSD file. The top layers will go on top of the other layers. You can use this to layer certain animations underneath others. If you layer a blink animation below... I dunno, a hair-blowing animation or a sweatdrop or something, the blink should go beneath the other layer and they shouldn't conflict. Hopefully. It's tricky to set-up, so you may need to go through some trial and error.
//As such you should always be mindful of the placement of your layers. Hair layers should go above eye layers, for example.
//This does NOT apply to replace, which does not care about layering and will pre-empt almost all other SERIKO functions like Always or Random. Which sucks. Be careful when using Replace.

//--Move
//The last of the animation functions and one that's really fairly simple. Move just moves the frame around your screen. This is handy when you want to move your character but don't want to draw a ton of frames for it.
//Here's an example from my Hunter and Smoker file. This is when Hunter would get hit in battle. She'd slide backwards a little bit.

//sliding back slightly
//0interval,runonce
//0pattern0,0,15,move,1,0
//0pattern1,0,5,move,2,0
//0pattern2,0,7,move,3,0
//0pattern3,0,10,move,4,0
//0pattern2,0,15,move,5,0

//As you saw above with the replace option, the last two numbers of any line are the x and y values. In this case, Hunter is sliding horizontally across the ground, so I changed the first number, the x. Over the course of five frames, she slides about five pixels back. You can adjust the timing by changing the number before move in each of them.
//You can use this to move your character around wherever you want. Horizontally, vertically, both at the same time, and at any speed you want. If you just set it to one frame with no delay, they'll just teleport over there.
//However, your character will stay where they moved unless you move them back, they go into another pose, or OnSurfaceRestore moves them back I think (see aitalk.dic). So you may want to set up some reverse move frames to bring them back to 0,0.
//One really handy use for move is making things bob up and down (like a thought bubble) without having to draw new frames for it.
