.x* SNATCHER *x.

FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!! You blew it! You totally screwed yourself! No one comes into my forest and leaves in... Wait, this isn't the Subcon Forest!

A really simple ghost (hehe) of Snatcher from A Hat in Time initially made for the 2022 Ghost Jam :] A little disaster's going on in the Subcon Forest, displacing everything and everyone. Since he's stuck on your desktop, might as well make you complete some contractual obligations and sit through some bad jokes, right?


- - IMPORTANT - -
-You can use "Shell Scaling" the SSP menu to change his size if he's too small/big for you. I made him really big so uh. You're probably gonna have to haha
-Make sure to uncheck Options > Preferences > ghost(2) > Balloon Scaling Linkage so his speech bubbles stay consistent when you scale him :)
-You can uninstall him by deleting the ph_snatcher folder out of your ssp/ghost/ directory, or by turning on uninstall in his personal menu, then selecting 'Uninstall' in the SSP menu.

-- Quick User Guide --
-Move your mouse back and forth over his head to pet him (you don't have to click)
-Double click his face to hit him (It'll warn you first, don't worry)
-Double click his body to open his personal menu
-Right click him to open the SSP menu
-Hit the T key when he's the focus to make him say something
-Hit the R key to make him repeat what he just said
-Hold down CTRL to speed through text











MINIMUM YAYA TEMPLATE TEXT------------REMOVE LATER

This template contains the bare basics for making a ghost with YAYA, and little else.

This is version v1.0.0, using YAYATc569-9.
You can check for new versions of YAYA here: https://github.com/ponapalt/yaya-shiori
And you can check for new versions of the system files (or pick up yaya_optional.dic for extra system functions) here: https://github.com/ponapalt/yaya-dic

Put together by Zichqec, but really this is just the default files so can I really lay any claim to it? But I suppose if you want to check for updates/download a clean version, they'll probably be here: https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/resources
Translations for the yaya_config.txt and system_config.txt provided by Ayaka!


Things I included that you could exclude:

• messagetxt folder (but then you wouldn't get error messages)
• install.txt (but then the ghost wouldn't be drag-and-drop installable)
• readme.txt (but then you wouldn't have this info)
• seriko.alignmenttodesktop,free in the shell's descript.txt (but then it would be bound to the bottom of the screen)
• seriko.use_self_alpha,1 in the shell's descript.txt (but then I would have to change the surfaces or they'd be invisible, and I don't feel like it)
• Commented out lines in system_config.txt for the yaya_optional.dic and yaya_compatible.dic files (in case you decide to add them, you'll have Ayaka's translations)
