i wanna brag abt their features cause where else am i gonna do that?! they have a genderfluid system set up, and they like talking about the weather (That they arranged. because theyre a weather demigod. ykyk). and tbh thats about it :) otherwise they just like talking about their villain group and the city.

JAM INFO:
NOT intended for new assets challenge. Intended for 72 hour challenge!
Imported code from Weather Station and X. Template. Everything else should be my code? Came off the dome but its from previous experience so. I hope that is ok.
Places of contention: 
- ALL weather station code? It's open source but im paranoid ykyk
- Custom pronouns code? lumi_menu.dic. i didnt copy paste anything but ive done a similar system in vera i think
