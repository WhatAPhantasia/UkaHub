Lady Tea & Master Mirror, v1.0.0
═══⟐═══

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- They have one or two dialogues that depend on your gender set in SSP preferences, make sure that's set correctly if you mind it!
- If you have the plugin Wallet of UNYU installed, you can switch to it in their settings menu for all transactions to be in UNYU :D See links at the bottom if you want to install UNYU related stuff!
- You can change the balloon font to Cuphead Felix in their settings menu for a more game accurate look, as long as you have the font installed! It's super illegible and doesn't have every single character that Cuphead Vogue has, though, so please keep it in mind!! It's really just a fun little feature for my own convenience hehe
