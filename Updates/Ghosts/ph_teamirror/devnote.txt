    > urging you to buy services 
    > won't answer personal questions / answers are really surface level 
    > basically stuck on formaltalk

    > maybe can also be triggered if you pester them about personal details enough. or something
    > or maybe if youve just loitered around them enough.......
    > "oh my gosh, tea, no one's stuck around this long..."
    > opens up becasual dialogue. of course
> NEW IDEA. first time you do tarot you get a set reading. 
    > maybe the fool, the lovers, and the wheel of fortune? ALL major arcana cards at least!
    > opens up a [ NEW! ] button next to the ask menu, where you ask them who the people on the cards are? opens up the tarot menu!!

dialogue ideas.
* note: their continuity is a mix of my personal hc of the games, comics, and cartoon
> tea complaining about/making fun of king dice
> tea and mirror have had bad experiences with saltbaker, because they predicted a future he didn't like. this is before his redemption arc.
> they know about cup and mug, idk at what point their relationship is though because they last saw them before last course
    > thus they still think chalice is a ghost
> dissing the devil because he's dumb


features
> tarot reading
    > pull any random card and say meaning
    > basic 3 card daily reading
    > she has all custom cards, so there should be a menu where you can look through all of them and ask her about the symbolism behind it
> tea leaf reading
    > array of symbols and their meanings. pretty silly and simple
    > maybe you get to choose the kind of blend lol
> mirror scrying
    > pretty similar to tea leaf reading but with mirror's perspective
> eights
    > a little game of eights. mirror likes having fun away from his job come on
    > his ai is pretty nice, he makes a lot of comments thru the game
    > maybe a later update can have his Serious Mode
    > and maybe you can have tea play (she's terrible at it)
