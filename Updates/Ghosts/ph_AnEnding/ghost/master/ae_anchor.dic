//— Flag System —
//Usage: This is intended to take the place of single-use variables that only contain 0 or 1, used as flags for certain events and such. With these functions, you can store all those flags as a single array, meaning you can make as many flags as you want without having to really worry about save bloat. It can also make your code a bit more readable!

//You'll want to put 'FlagArray = IARRAY' into your OnFirstBoot. That'll set up an empty array for flags to be stored in.
//When you want to check if a flag is set or not, you can do it like so:
//if Flag("My Flag") == 0
//or
//if Flag("My Flag") == 1

//Any flags that are NOT in the array are 0, and any flags that ARE in the array are 1. So, to set a flag to 1, you add it to the array like this:
//AddFlag("My Flag")

//If you want to set a flag back to 0, you can remove it like so:
//RemoveFlag("My Flag")

//Flag names can be just about anything you want! They're just stored as strings. For example, for S I have "Saw Gaster with googly eyes", and for Lulo I have things like "Unlocked MP3 player" and "Unlocked journal". If you want to see what flags are set, you can just put %(FlagArray) into script input, so it's helpful to have names that describe the flag!

//Checks to see if a flag exists. Returns 1 if yes, returns 0 if no
Flag
{
	if !ISVAR("FlagArray"); FlagArray = IARRAY
	if ASEARCH(_argv[0],FlagArray) != -1; 1
	else; 0
}

//Adds a flag to the array
AddFlag
{
	if !ISVAR("FlagArray"); FlagArray = IARRAY
	if !Flag(_argv); FlagArray ,= _argv
}

//Removes all instances of a flag in the array
