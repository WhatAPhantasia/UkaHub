//Execution log
//The execution log is recorded in ayame.log. It is recommended to keep logs during development.

ignoreiolog, ID: OnSecondChange //OnSecondChange無視
ignoreiolog, ID: OnMouse        //OnMouse系無視

//These are here because I always forget the formatting. You can use these in place of ignoreiolog, and it will allow you to use it like a whitelist! But also, if you just do OnMouse like I have it below, it filters out ALL the mouse events, which is not how ignoreiolog works. Unsure if that's a bug or not.
