!!CW: abuse/neglect, derealization (lgbtphobia/ableism, death, & suicide in config menu)
!!(she has READABILITY + SENSITIVE CONTENT SETTINGS in her CONFIG MENU)


something from the remnants of a DOOMED WORLD... maybe.

her name is VERA THANDI. she's a little SLEEPY and her MEMORY is really FOGGY, but she's here and wants to be your FRIEND :)
you can give her a place to REST... in return, she can TALK to YOU, her FRIENDS, and play a few GAMES!

big thanks to zichqec, zarla, and the udt discord server :) vera is built/referenced heavily on a lot of things from them so..!! check them out in the credits under stats!!
built on X. Template v1.1.3.

- - IMPORTANT user guide - -
- move your mouse back and forth over her head to pet her
- you can also brush her hair by moving your mouse over her lower hair
- double click her face to boop her (or...?)
- double click elsewhere to open her personal menu
- right click her to open the SSP menu
- hit the t key when she's the focus to make her say something
- hit the r key to make her repeat what she just said
- hold down ctrl to speed through text
- use "shell scaling" in the SSP menu to change her size
- uncheck options > preferences > ghost(2) > balloon scaling linkage so her speech bubbles stay consistent when you scale her
- you can uninstall her by selecting 'uninstall' in the right click menu (or by deleting the ph_AnEnding folder out of your ssp/ghost/ directory, but i don't recommend it.)

NOTE FOR DEVS: you are completely free to reference ANY of my code, i do not care. i am only putting this here because i found myself asking this to people and i just wanna clarify im fine with it yk :3 however if you copy paste chunks of code without changing much, like my tarot card minigame or anything, please credit me somewhere! i wont be mad if you dont. just very disappointed.
