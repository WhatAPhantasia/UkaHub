something from the remnants of a DOOMED WORLD... maybe.

you meet a girl named VERA THANDI on the roof of your APARTMENT COMPLEX. she's a little SLEEPY and her MEMORY is really FOGGY, but she's here. 
maybe you can HANG OUT? in return, she can TALK to YOU, her FRIENDS... and OTHER THINGS, too, if you UNLOCK them. 

big thanks to zichqec, zarla, and the udt discord server :) vera is built/referenced heavily on a lot of things from them so..!! check them out in the credits under stats!!
built on X. Template v1.1.3.

- - IMPORTANT user guide - -
- move your mouse back and forth over her head to pet her
- you can also brush her hair by moving your mouse over her lower hair
- double click her face to boop her (or...?)
- double click elsewhere to open her personal menu
- right click her to open the SSP menu
- hit the t key when she's the focus to make her say something
- hit the r key to make her repeat what she just said
- hold down ctrl to speed through text
- use "shell scaling" in the SSP menu to change her size
- uncheck options > preferences > ghost(2) > balloon scaling linkage so her speech bubbles stay consistent when you scale her
- you can uninstall her by selecting 'uninstall' in the right click menu (or by deleting the ph_AnEnding folder out of your ssp/ghost/ directory, but i don't recommend it.)
