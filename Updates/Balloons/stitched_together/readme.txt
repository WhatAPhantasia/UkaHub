stitched together v0.9

balloon themed around buttons and stitches :) i built this with faeia and tahir in mind, so yes! the buttons do have meanings! but for the most part this is multipurpose and u can use it for whatever you want.
feel free to swap around the balloon numbers if you want a particular button.

for jam, only three buttons are available. i dont want to draw more rn </3
